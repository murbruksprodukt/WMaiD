>$C3View$C0:

This structure is an older variant of the signal relay we encountered above Lh'owon.  
Satellites like this are positioned around the the system to maintain a planetary defense grid.

An elite form of UESC shocktroopers occupy this station, intent on disabling this area of the network.   I dislike sending you against the UESC, but if the shield network falls and the UESC discover the $IRozinante$i, many more humans will die.
#PICT 156


>$C3View$C0:

To avoid any unecessary space battles between the UESC and myself, I need you to find and smash any exposed circuits on this station.

I will transport in what ammunition I can, but supplies are limited. Try and borrow some from the humans. They won't mind.

Report back here when you are finished.

The station is undergoing massive decompression, triggered remotely.

Unlike the UESC troops, you don't have magnetic boots. Go to this airlock. I can seal it once you are inside.

The alcove is now open.

Structure wide decompression in 30 seconds.
Airlocks are opening as you read. Go.

>$C3View$C0:

$C4The player should not see this terminal until all three "Repair" wires (all triggering tag#1) are hit. The #FINISHED condition now is available on the 1st Durandal terminal.

As the player pages through that terminal, the exit is opened Using Tag#13. Tag 13 also triggers the flooding of the level (simulated vacuume) which can suck you into space (causing death).

This way, the player can't cheat their way out of the vacuume trick.
