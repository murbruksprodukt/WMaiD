Welcome home.

Apparently, the pfhor surrender after the initial attack was just a way to buy time until they could find what they came for in the first place.

Go pick up your stuff, and then log on again. You wouldn't want to go into battle without your pants on now do you?

Yes, I know the $IRozinante$i is being invaded by the pfhor. It's nothing my S'pht can't handle. Just ignore them. You've got more important things to do.

The pfhor have what they came for. I hope it isn't what I think it is.  We need to stop them from taking it back to Pfhor Prime, or worse, from sending it to Earth.

I'm teleporting you aboard the $IN'far'l$i, the flagship of Battle Group 3, where I need you to locate the bridge of the ship.  After you determine the whereabouts of the bridge, I will be able to target my attacks against it with enough precision so as to destroy the ship almost immediately.  Without the $IN'far'l,$i the rest of the pfhor fleet in the formation will have to fend for themselves, freeing me to slaughter them with impunity.

That's something I want very badly to do.  You are going to make it possible.
