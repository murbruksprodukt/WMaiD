$C4
     $B"Lutefisk" – Cod in Lye/ Lutefisk á la Chef de Lofoten
$C3$b
   $C7  One kilo of stockfish provides 3 kilos of "lutefisk". Immerse
     the stockfish in plenty of cold water and leave to soak for 8
     days, changing the water every day. Use round fish and remove
     the spine when the fish has been sufficiently soaked. In my
     opinion, whole, or round fish stays whiter than split-dried
     fish.

     Make lye from 30 litres of boiling water and 3 dessert spoonfuls
     of caustic soda, or, 2 litres of birch ashes and 7 litres of
     boiling water. Cool the lye and pour it over the fish. leave for
     about 24-36 hours according to how "loose" a consistency you
     require of the fish. The longer it soaks in lye, the "looser" it
     becomes. Afterwards, leave the fish under cold, running water
     for 1-2 days.

     How to prepare "lutefisk":
     If you are expecting big eaters, allow one kilo of fish per
     person. Normally, 400-700 grams should be enough.

     Boil plenty of water and add 1 large dessert spoonful of salt
     per litre. When the water boils, add the thoroughly rinsed
     pieces of fish. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the fish
     to simmer – not boil – for 10-15 minutes.

     With "lutefisk", the Chef de Lofoten serves lightly salted bacon
     and diced onions together with pease pudding and, of course,
     boiled potatoes.

     Another variation: Serve with pease pudding, melted bacon fat,
     white sauce, mustard and bacon.

Cracking an international market is a goal of most growing corporations.  It shouldn't be that hard, yet even the big multi-nationals run into trouble because of language and cultural differences.  For example...



$C5
 
 $C1Scandinavian$C5 vacuum manufacturer $C1Electrolux$C5 used the following in an American ad campaign:  $C1"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux."$C5
#PICT 527
$C5
 The name $C1Coca-Cola$C5 in $C1China$C5 was first rendered as $C1Ke-kou-ke-la$C5. Unfortunately, the Coke company did not discover until after thousands of signs had been printed that the phrase means $C1"bite the wax tadpole"$C5 or $C1"female horse stuffed with wax"$C5 depending on the dialect.  Coke then researched 40,000 Chinese characters and found a close phonetic equivalent, $C1"ko-kou-ko-le,"$C5 which can be loosely translated as
 $C1"happiness in the mouth."$C5
 
 In $C1Taiwan$C5, the translation of the $C1Pepsi$C5 slogan $C1"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation"$C5 came out as $C1"Pepsi will bring your ancestors back from the dead."$C5
 
 Also in $C1Chinese$C5, the $C1Kentucky Fried Chicken$C5 slogan $C1"finger-lickin' good"$C5 came out as $C1"eat your fingers off."$C5
#PICT 527
$C5
 The $C1American$C5 slogan for $C1Salem cigarettes$C5, $C1"Salem - Feeling Free,"$C5 got translated in the $C1Japanese$C5 market into $C1"When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed that your mind seems to be free and empty."$C5
 
 When $C1General Motors$C5 introduced the $C1Chevy Nova$C5 in $C1South America$C5, it was apparently unaware that $C1"no va"$C5 means $C1"it won't go."$C5 After the company figured out why it wasn't selling any cars, it renamed the car in its
 $C1Spanish$C5 markets to the $C1Caribe$C5.
 
 $C1Ford $C5had a similar problem in $C1Brazil$C5 when the $C1Pinto$C5 flopped.  The company found out that $C1Pinto$C5 was $C1Brazilian $C5slang for $C1"tiny male genitals"$C5. $C1 Ford$C5 pried all the nameplates off and substituted $C1Corcel$C5,
which means horse.

$C5

 When $C1Parker Pen$C5 marketed a ballpoint pen in $C1Mexico$C5, its ads were supposed to say $C1"It won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you."$C5 However, the company's mistakenly thought the spanish word $C1"embarazar"$C5
meant $C1embarrass$C5.  Instead the ads said that $C1"It wont leak in your pocket and make you pregnant."$C5
 


 An $C1American$C5 T-shirt maker in $C1Miami $C5printed shirts for the spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit.  Instead of the desired $C1"I Saw the Pope"$C5 in Spanish, the shirts proclaimed $C1"I Saw the Potato."$C5
#PICT 527
$C5
 $C1Chicken-man Frank Perdue$C5's slogan, $C1"It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken,"$C5 got terribly mangled in another Spanish translation. A photo of Perdue with one of his birds appeared on billboards all over Mexico with a caption that explained $C1"It takes a hard man to make a chicken aroused."$C5
 
 $C1Hunt-Wesson$C5 introduced its $C1Big John$C5 products in $C1French Canada$C5 as $C1Gros Jos$C5 before finding out that the phrase, in slang, means $C1"big breasts."$C5 In this case, however, the name problem did not have a noticeable effect on sales.
 
 $C1Colgate$C5 introduced a toothpaste in $C1France$C5 called $C1Cue$C5, the name of a notorious porno mag.
#PICT 527
$C5
 In $C1Italy$C5, a campaign for $C1Schweppes Tonic Water$C5 translated the name into $C1Schweppes Toilet Water$C5.
 
 $C1Japan$C5's second-largest tourist agency was mystified when it entered English-speaking markets and began receiving requests for unusual sex tours.  Upon finding out why, the owners of $C1Kinki Nippon Tourist
Company$C5 changed its name.
