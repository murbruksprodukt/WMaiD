I have a surprise present for our dear friend Tycho. It's on an uplink chip. Go get it. It should be somewhere around here.

And remember to grab some ammo while you're at it.

All of our gruntwork for Tycho has paid off.  I'm managed to maneuver him into a highly compromised position, a position I plan on exploiting.  The chip you're carrying contains a masterfully designed virus, if I do say so myself.  Insert it once you're aboard the $IKahc'Trie$i, and Tycho will find himself aboard a time bomb that will turn him and everything in a 24.52x3 km radius into space dust when I so decide.
