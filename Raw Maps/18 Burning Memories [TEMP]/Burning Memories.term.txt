$C1“$C5You would do great in the military. You certainly have the discipline.$C1"

The dark haired man set down his tablet, and reclined in the chair. 
"$C5Thanks for the morale boost, but I’m doing fine drawing pictures for a living.$C1”

A man sat across from his friend, idly playing with a nearby gravity weight.

Comforted by an echoing sense of purpose, the man knew he was on the right path.

$C1The man listened to his friend's footsteps receded down the hall until only the familiar background hum remained. 
He stepped out into the hallway, and resealed the airlock. 

He should go tell his wife the good news.
