I've transported you into the maintaince section of a Jjaro communication node.

After the UESC's initial attack, our pale three-eyed friends have increased security on key locations planetside. This is one of them.  

The Pfhor's compilers are busy working away to get this relay station working.  I don't want them to succeed.

>$C3View$C0:

If you can break every interface point you find, the $IRozaintae $iwill have a direct link to the outpost's intranet. The first of which is located directly above this terminal. 

I'll do what I can to send down ammunition. Take care, and keep an eye on the time. We've a schedule to keep.

This area has two shielded access nodes that I need destroyed. They're suspended off the ground with a very long drop below. Find some way to access and blast both nodes for me.

I could entertain you with an account of the events in orbit, but we don't have the time.

I've located a series of artifacts with the $IRozinante's$i new intranet connection. I'm sending you to a shipping citadel currently held by the UESC.  Also, this storage building is located amidst the heaviest fighting. 

Charge up before transporting. I'm sending you in without a smoke break.
