The Jjaro construct is more tenacious than I had anticipated. While he cannot affect me directly, he's providing intelligence to the Pfhor's compilers on your location.

Don't get caught off guard by the shock troops beaming in nearby.

>View:


The UESC and the Pfhor are fighting a few thousand kilometers of $IRozinante's$i aft quarter.

You have less than five minutes before the infantry of both sides clash on you.


Be swift or be dead, as they say.

While we were out of contact, it seems you managed to get the attention of this installation's AI, Khensu.

Keep in mind this entity ensnared an entire Nebulon fleet, murdered the crews, and sent the vessels on a galactic expedition. He wasn't passing out brochures, but the result was the same. He drew the Pfhor here, with the UESC not far behind, and I want to know why.

I asked Thoth about these matters, but he was no help. I honestly don't know why I keep him around.

>View:

The messages the Jjaro AI's sent you thus far are cryptic, but innocuous. I hope Khensu is like our friend Thoth: slow, uninteresting, and obsessed with keeping his world balanced. As long as he stays out of my way, I'm content to read his crazy poetry.

Once you've reactivated the power cells, find a nearby jumppad for transport.

We're in trouble. Khensu has routed a Pfhor strike force to your location, and locked down access to the power cells I need activated.

Use the weapons I've transported down for you to hold off the slavers until I can hack through our crazy friends lockout routines.  Once the doors open, run.

This installation's AI is clearly rampant, but not in any stage I can recognize. He can't affect the $IRozinante$i for some reason, but he seems bent on killing you. Keep your wits about you down there.

Activate the power cells depicted on your left by breaking the panels in front of each; I'll take care of the rest.

Watch out for Khensu's defense drones, and return to this terminal when you've finished your mission.

Now that you've restored power in this area, I need a way to interface with the structures on this ancient world.

I'll give you further instructions at our next location.

Step on to the jumppad for transport.
