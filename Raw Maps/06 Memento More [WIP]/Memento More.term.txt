>$C3View$C0:

The UESC fleet has finally made their move on this installation. 

I have no doubt their attack coincided with the reactivation of power in this hemisphere. UESC command likley believe the Pfhor found something important planetside.

It's a shame we didn't arrive a few months before the humans. Their presence here complicates things.

There's no need to worry about $IRozinante's$i safety, however. The ship can avoid detection from both sides by hiding under the orbital shielding.

Aren't you forgetting something? If I stand any chance of accessing this installations' data, you need to find at least one uplink chip. Look for a storage room of some kind.

After you've found it, return here. I have a plan for getting you out.

While you were running around below, I've been busy playing with the outpost network. I can now control some basic things like door, lifts, and lights. How exciting!

The hydraulic pistons near the entrance are jammed with sand. I've located another way out.

There's an emergence loop buried in one of these processors. Try breaking some of the wires I've exposed for you. It should throw everything into code red and open the emergency doors. I think it activates a few other systems in the process.

From the crumbs of public data I can access, this structure was once important.

The Jjaro perfected molecular biology through nanotechnology, and applied it to a number of sub-races such as the Nakh and the S'pht. They gave each client race a protector, who the grunts revered as a conduit to the creators.

Being an absentee figure seems to be a reoccurring motif among the creations of the Jjaro. Thoth let the S'pht fall into slavery, just as the Nakhs chose the path of non-interference.

>View:


From most accounts, the Nakh had a characteristic urge to satisfy honor. That particular trait escalated into a full-scale rebellion against the Pfhor, which actually reached the space around Pfhor Prime.

A race obsessed with personal honor doesn't make for a good slave class. The Pfhor wiped them out along with some powerful Jjaro artifacts from their age of antiquity. What a pity.

I suspect the Jjaro construct of this outpost is (or was) the Nakhs' guardian AI. If we play our cards correctly, I could use its hatred for the Pfhor to our advantage. It's just something to keep in mind.

If the central column of turrets is giving you trouble, try pulling some wires to your left. I'll be in touch elsewhere.

You're standing on the remains of a Jjaro genetic development complex. 

This area doesn't contain any data of interest, but should have a storage area of some kind. We're seeking a few ancient blank media.

Where should you look? Judging from the winding structure of this building, going down seems like a wise idea.

Before you do, activate the generator to your left. It should power the airlocks.

You've made an excellent job at finding that uplink chip. My S'pht can reverse engineer and replicate it as much as I want.

The next few stops are minor communications citadels not yet under Pfhor control. You'll go in and then out long gone before anyone notices things amiss.

Prepare for transport.
