$C4This is a temp replacement level for a map I'm currently working on. In it, Durandal sends you down to another Jjaro citadel.

$C0The old version of the level was this:
Durandal has you activate a relay so he can get more electronic-data on some secret Jjaro hidden weapon.$C4

$C5Now:$C4 You're looking for a mysterious ancient artifact of Jjaro design. 
Durandal needs it for undisclosed reasons.

At the levels end, just before Durandal teleports you out...$C0

Take the uplink I have provided, and install it within a rooftop transponder.

Once the uplink is in place, it will only take a few seconds for me to gain control of this buildings network.  Look for a nearby terminal once the array is activated.

>View:

You may noticed numerous explosive spheres scattered about the citadels. As it happens, they're laid by the Jjaro drones as part of their guerrilla warfare mode. The mines operate on a simple, but deadly detect and detonate routine. 

I'd be a negligent Ai if I didn't tell you to shoot these things from afar; particular near large groups of hostile troops. 

If the oppertinity arises, of course.
#PICT 175


>View:

Keep moving upward to locate the uplink point. Unless you can fly, take care in navigating the damaged section of this building. From orbit, I can see the drones mining every ledge in sight. 

I hope you were not exaggerating the extent of your sharp shooting skills on the Tau Ceti colony. Bragging can be hazardous to your health in this situation.
