This historical transmission is intended to serve as an enclosure of supporting information to file #iso-342107 $C2<$C6ref$C2#$C6 deleted$C2>$C1. It documents the pivotal events that shaped the direction of humanity, and our place in the universe.

Among social and military historians of the early colonial period, there is solid agreement that the United Earth Space Council's (UESC) decision to seize the ancient outpost orbiting rogue star $C5WD0346+246$C1 led to broad spanning social and technological implications. The events surrounding $C5WD0346+246$C1 for the past three hundred years were muddled in conflicting accounts and disinformation. Only recently have the military records of the event become declassified and made available to the general public.
