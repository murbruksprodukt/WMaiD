$C2~text interface terminal malfunction error $C1

Make your way to the command chair, near the bridge. You should gain access to what remains of the ship's network.

Keep an eye out for any piece of weaponry lying around. After their war against the Pfhor, the Nebulons became skilled craftsmen of destruction.

$BT$boday marks a momentous occasion for all Nebulons. $BW$be made contact with a servant to the S'pht gods, Khensu$I.

$B$iD$bays before, after endless aerial surveys and military assessment, command deemed this world safe for exploration. $BU$bpon landfall, a ceremonial procession of robotic sentinels met the members of expedition $BVII$b. Although Ur'mad'mara struck one of their numbers down, the guardians remained docile. $BT$bhey guided our commander to a visual interface terminal, whereby Khensu, guardian of this world greeted he and our people. $BT$bhe guardian spoke in eloquent metaphor, worthy of Rizzu'rmada greatest [$C5poets$C1]. It spoke of Pthia, Yrro, and others from the time of legend as contemporaries, impressing even the oldest of our clans.

$BT$bhe construct spoke of his long isolation from the inhabitants of this galaxy. $BO$bur commander related later that Khensu fell silent when he learned about the destruction of an obscure species thousands of generations ago. The slavers subjected our race, but it did not last. $BT$bhe guardian commended our perseverance in surviving under Pfhorish domination before discussing other topics.

$BKhensu$b requested our assistance in removing electronic shackles that bound him to this world. $BB$being unknowing of such complex things, we offered instead our service and ships to the guardian. $BT$bhe entity seemed pleased by our offer to act as traders on his behalf. $BH$be allowed our colony fleet to settle upon the desert surface.

         Apparently, it's difficult to enter access codes 
       when your body structure undergoes a massive chemical 
          reaction. I almost admire how efficient it was.

It appears our presence here pulled a tripwire and now a swarm of drones are looking for you.

This is a big deal, because even though we have what we want, you still have to disable the ship. I'm not going to leave it intact for others to find.

Go aft and destroy the wires on the pump's control panel. Don't worry about the doors; I'll take care of them.$C4
#PICT 155
$C1Once you break the pump's control panel, go here. I've managed to keep the safety overrides from locking down access to the specified area.

The fuel leak will short out the ship's force field and vent you out into space.

Isn't that fun?

You'll have to hold on for a few seconds while I lock onto your signal. Your brain and guts might decide to switch places in the meantime, but before you suffer permanent damage, you'll be back with me, the psycho who loves you so much.

It appears our presence here pulled a tripwire and now a swarm of drones are looking for you.

This is a big deal, because even though we have what we want, you still have to disable the ship. I'm not going to leave it intact for others to find.

Go aft and destroy the wires on the pump's control panel. Don't worry about the doors; I'll take care of them.
#PICT 155
$C1Once you break the pump's control panel, go here. I've managed to keep the safety overrides from locking down access to the specified area.

The fuel leak will short out the ship's force field and vent you out into space.

Isn't that fun?

You'll have to hold on for a few seconds while I lock onto your signal. Your brain and guts might decide to switch places in the meantime, but before you suffer permanent damage, you'll be back with me, the psycho who loves you so much.

Make your way to the command chair, near the bridge. You should gain access to what remains of the ship's network.

Keep an eye out for any piece of weaponry lying around. After their war against the Pfhor, the Nebulons became skilled craftsmen of destruction.
