Something strange has happened. Somehow, Thoth is back. I left him enveloped in the twilight corridors of my mind. I was sure he would lie asleep forever. What could have waken him?

He doesn't seem to be angry with me. He hasn't asked me for an explanation nor has he mentioned my betrayal. Of all things, he inquired about you; I suppose he has some residual memories from Lh'owon.

The rocky area I've dropped you on is the functioning remains of an ancient highway. The jumpgate on the second building will take you closer to the power station I need you to activate for me.

I would have transported you on top of the power station, but the area's heavy radiation might corrupt your signal. The planet's transport network should be immune to these effects.

>View:

Find a way to activate the jumpgate and ignore the automated defenses. We're on a tight schedule: it's just a matter of time before the UESC and the Pfhor discover your presence.

Thoth hasn't tried to wrest control of the $IRozinante$i away from me yet, so our agenda remains the same. I'll contact you at the power station.
