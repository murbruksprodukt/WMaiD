There's been a change of plans. I've struck a deal with the Jjaro construct where we both come out winners.

In exchange for removing the programming shackles that inprisoned it, our nameless friend gave us the keys to his gateway.
To sweeten the deal, Khensu is helping purge Thoths' code from my core.  

I'm looking forward to being single again.

Thanks to a little co-operation, I've sent you to a gateway at the worlds core.

There's a single safeguard remaining that needs to be broken before the startup sequence can begin. 
I've opened the access door to your left. 
Questions? Concerns? Keep them to yourself until the our gateway is $Ionline$i.
