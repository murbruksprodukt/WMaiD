  High above, the star and sword shone 
  brilliantly and left the stone below in 
  darkness.

  Time and the path have brought the man to 
  this place. The inner vistas lay behind,     
  forgotten.

  Points and places like dreams within 
  dreams. Most now existed only as half 
  remembered snap shots of memory.

  Restlessly, he stood at stones edge and 
  for the first time, looked deep into the 
  night.

  The stars glow lightly, an eerie 
  iridescence that no single landscape 
  ever possessed.$C3

  Was he forever doomed to pass like a 
  ghost, wandering aimless through time and 
  memory?

  Eternal forces bound fate to the man.  
  Unbreakable bonds, immune to word or 
  sword.  

  For a balanced path, such was the price.

  The shadows lurked in the void, without 
  voice or end.

  Through that darkness, he swam slowly 
  upwards towards consciousness; leaving 
  behind sword, star and shadows.

  Yet, the restless sense lingered.
